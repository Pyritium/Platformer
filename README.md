# Platformer

This is my first attempt at a project in C++! I know this is super messy & probably not the most professional!
I'm very new to C++ and I really want to know all about it, so I'm super excited to
Dive into the language, I just have to get there and ultimately learn.

For those who also want to do the same and learn, this is an open source project! Go ahead and read the code
to learn!
